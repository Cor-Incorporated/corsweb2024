# My Life Transformed After a Year of Weekly Lightning Talks

As a "cliffhanger, inexperienced engineer-entrepreneur," I challenged myself to give a lightning talk (LT) every week for a year. The changes this brought were far beyond just improving my technical skills.

## Background of the Challenge

### Dealing with ASD

I was diagnosed with ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder) as an adult.  Difficulties with communication have always been a challenge in my life.

### The Path to Entrepreneurship

From music to engineering, and then to becoming an entrepreneur.  Throughout this journey, I developed a strong desire for "misunderstanding-free communication."

## A Year's Journey

### Q1: Facing My Fears

```markdown
# Initial Challenges
- Fear of public speaking
- Lack of ability to organize technical content
- Exploring how to engage with the community
```

### Q2: Habit Formation

Preparing for weekly LTs became part of my daily routine, creating a rhythm for learning.

### Q3: Connecting with the Community

```javascript
// Expanding Community Activities
const communityActivities = [
  'Tech meetup presentations',
  'Online community contributions',
  'Mentoring junior developers',
  'Open source contributions'
];
```

### Q4: Transformation into a New Self


## Results Achieved

- **Technical Skills**: Deepened understanding to an explainable level.
- **Communication Skills**: Acquired structured speaking skills.
- **Networking**: Connected with engineers nationwide.
- **Confidence**: Overcame the fear of public speaking.

## Elevating to Cor.Inc.'s Mission

This experience is directly related to the company's mission: "To realize 'misunderstanding-free communication' with AI technology."

It was the moment when a personal challenge transformed into a passion for solving social problems.
